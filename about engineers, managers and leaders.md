# Engineers, Managers and Leaders

### A Good Engineer
* develops a sense of ownership and authority for his/her experience at work.
* does not rely on the manager to set the entire tone of their relationship. 
* realizes uncertainty is a constant and utilize the manager's help to pull through during tough times. 
* asks for feedback and takes it graciously even when he/she doesn't agree with it. 
* does not shy away from asking, when he/she needs something (help, raise, work-life balance, promotion).
* sets a goal and do what he/she can to make it happen. 
* views communication as a corner stone of engineering. He/she knows the audience, communicates the intent of his/her action clearly. Documentations and presentations are tools that a good engineer uses to his advantage. 

### A Good Manager 
* helps you grow in your career.
* gives you valuable feedback on your work immediately.
* praises you publicly to reinforce positive behaviour in the team. 
* criticizes you privately to help you grow. 
* helps you navigate difficult times.
* helps you understand what is important to focus on. 
* shows how your day-to-day work contributes to the overall success of the company.

### 1:1 Meetings
1:1 meetings are essestial in forming a mutual trust between a manager and an engineer. 
* Every engineer should share the responsibility of having a constructive 1:1 with their managers. 
* Prepare what you'd like to share with your manager before hand. 

### Everyone Should Strive To Be A Leader
It does not matter if you are an engineer or a manager, everyone should strive to be a leader. A leader listens intently and doesn't spend all the time thinking about what to say next. A leader creates a culture of excellence and trusts in his peers ability to do their job. You are not a leader if you belive that correctness is so much more important than anything else; and it is always worth fighting hard for what you believe is correct. A leader should let go of their identity  as the smartest person in the room. Finally a leader should enable his peers to be leaders.
