# Managers and Engineers
### A good manager 
* helps you grow in your career.
* gives you valuable feedback on your work immediately.
* praises you publicly to reinforce positive behaviour in the team. 
* criticizes you privately to help you grow. 
* helps you navigate difficult times.
* helps you understand what is important to focus on. 
* shows how your day-to-day work contributes to the overall success of the company.
* should listen intently and not spend all the time thinking about what to say next.

### A good engineer
* should develop a sense of ownership and authority for his/her experience at work.
* should not rely on the manager to set the entire tone of their relationship. 
* should realize uncertainty is a constant and utilize the manager's help to pull through during tough times. 
* should ask for feedback and take it graciously even when he/she doesn't agree with it. 
* should not shy away from asking for it, when he/she needs something (help, raise, work-life balance, promotion).
* should set a goal and do what he/she can to make it happen. 

### 1:1 meetings
1:1 meetings are essestial in forming a mutual trust between a manager and an engineer. 
* Every engineer should share the responsibility of having a constructive 1:1 with their managers. 
* Prepare what you'd like to share with your manager before hand.
